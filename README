1. Our project is mainly focused in providing the user a mathematical program which 
will help him to solve various mathematical operations required in his day to day life. 
2. Our project along with scientific calculator consists of root finder, simultaneous 
equation solver, Complex calculator, Volume finder, Area finder, Derivative and 
integral calculator etc. This allows the student to solve various study related problems 
in an easier way. 
3. In a world where, people are moving towards virtual reality, our virtual calculator 
program allows the user to calculate using hand gestures.
4. This project gave us an opportunity to research more on GUI applications and OpenCV module which enabled us to use the camera module and hand-detection module.
5. Finally, a scientific calculator is a necessity now for each and every student and hence 
we think this project will attract more number of students to use it.
